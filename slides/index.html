            <h2>What is Mao?</h2>
            <p>
              Mao is a card game in which players compete to get rid of all their
			  hand. It has the following rules:
			  <ul>
                <li> A player can only put a card down if it is the same suit or rank to the previous one </li>
				<li> Players are penalized if they do not follow rules that depend on the history of the game. </li>
				<li> The winner of each round gets to add a new secret rule that the other players need to abide by (by trial and error). </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
          </section>
        <section>
			  <h2>Why ZK?</h2>
			  <p>Zero knoweledge allows players to trust that the person penalizing them is actually following a predecided rule.</p>
		 </section>
		 <section>
			<h2>Our Project</h2>
			<p>We developed a two-player simplified version of Mao, the game goes as follows:</p>
			<ul>
                <li> At the end of each round, players randomly draw tokens from a set of personal tokens, the drawn token determines the penalty of the player's next rule. (the random scheme is also based on snarks) </li>
				<li> Rules are restricted to being binary, and to only consider the last two moves</li>
            </ul>

				<h1>A Live demo</h1>
		</section>
		<section>
			<section>
				<h2>How does it work?</h2>
				<li> A new rule is encoded as a bitmap (using the bits of 29 integers).</li>
				<li> A hash of the rule is shared with the other player.</li>
				<li> In each step, each player verifies whether the other broke one of his rules, and produces a proof that a rule with the hash he shared is broken.</li>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Limits and future development?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li> make snarks faster. (example bit access). </li>
					<li> experiment with other zk technologies.</li>
					<li> Add support to more than two players.</li>
					<li> Make proof verification faster by sending proofs on a rolling bases.</li>

				</ul>
